# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. My pronouns are she/her, I am interested in developing games through coding as well as the visual/design aspect of things. I love playing action-adventure games like The Last of Us, The Walking Dead, Detroit: Become human, and Until Dawn. I am taking this class so that I can improve my coding skills to become more fluent.
2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [x] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. I am hoping to get better at coding to make it easier for me to translate my thoughts and ideas for games into code.
4. I am a little bit nervous about jumping into new material right away, but I'm sure after a bit of adjusting and learning everything will be fine.
## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.
